/// file that tries to mimic the behaviour of the file optfields.rs 
/// optfields.rs find, parse and dtore all the different types of
/// optional fields associated to each kind of lines.
/// with the format GFA2 the optional field tag is been replaced by a 
/// simple tag element with 0 or N occurencies.
